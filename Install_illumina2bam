download illumina2bam
install java 8 sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre
install ant (compiler) sudo apt-get install ant
dowload Bcel and put bcel-6.2.jar (or whatever the version is) in /usr/share/ant/lib
dont bother with ant test, it will get errors or not but the compilation in the next step should work in either case (hopefully)
run 'ant jar' while in illumina2bam folder
